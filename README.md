# Development

A conda virtual environment named ``vtk-surface-data`` will be created by executing ``conda devenv -f environment.devenv.yml``.

Note that you must have the conda-devenv package installed in your base conda environment. To install conda-devenv, execute ``conda install -c conda-forge conda-devenv``.

Then enter the conda environment with ``conda activate vtk-surface-data``.
